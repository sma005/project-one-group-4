4. Income 
5. Ethnicity
6. Diet
7. Age
8. Which one of these is the highest indicator


Project Work Flow
1. Determine sources
2. Develop Frame
3. Split up tasks
4. Analyse the data and make plots to show mean, median, mode, correlations etc.
5. Go over the completed project - ensure we are not missing an data
6. Discuss how to present in class.
