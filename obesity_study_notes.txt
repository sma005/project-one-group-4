5. What percent of adults who report consuming vegetables less than one time daily?
    a. 
    b.
    
  
6. What is the linear regression of questions 3, 4, 5?
7. What is the largest indicator of obesity?



Analysis and Conclusion (20 points)
Write-up summarizes major findings and implications at a professional level (5 points)
Each question in the project proposal is answered with precise descriptions and findings (5 points)
Findings are strongly supported with numbers and visualizations (5 points)
Each question response is supported with a well-discerned statistical analysis from lessons (e.g., aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis)



Project Work Flow
1. Determine sources
2. Develop Frame
3. Split up tasks
4. Analyse the data and make plots to show mean, median, mode, correlations etc.
5. Go over the completed project - ensure we are not missing an data
6. Discuss how to present in class.






***********************************************************************************
Notes from Steve:
Hey y'all. A lot of the columns that I thought had data, were actually just NaN.
Not sure how those columns came through if the JSON doesn't match.
This is the info that I can pull from our previous meetings
 -State (Geographic Location)
 -Diet
 -Age
 -Diet(there are very specific questions)
 
That's only 4
 
I also did some exploration, and I can see that there are a lot of Nan values for the Age Group. I don't know if this is a sum, or more people who just didn't specify their age.

Observe that I didn't use an API key for this data set. Not sure if we need to use another one from this site that uses an API key.

A lot of what I did is just so we can see what we are working with. We may not want to keep it for our project.
************************************************************************************













1. Geographic location
2. Education levels
3. Crime Rates
4. Income 
5. Ethnicity
6. Diet
7. Age
8. Which one of these is the highest indicator













---------------------------------------------------------
Old project: Data is too spread out
QUESTIONS

Find the correlation between literacy and quality of life (high blood pressure/disease/cancer/etc...)

Connection between literacy rate and life expectancy?
Connection between literacy rate and cancer?

???Unemployment levels and literacy rates?

Age Group Affected?

Geographic Area?
Ethnicities?

Key words to use while searching for APIs

--------------------------------------------------
THINGS WE NEED TO FIND...
Population
#s of health ailments (cancer/high blood pressure/etc...)
Graduation rates
???Income
Quality of life(Physical/Psycological/Social Relationship/Environment)(Mean score)

http://healthliteracymap.unc.edu/ (Raw datasets)
---------------------------------------------------

1.Measures of central tendencies for literacy (broken down by ethnicity)
2.Measures of central tendencies for quality of life (broken down by ethnicity)
3.Top 5 areas for literacy (broken down by ethnicity)
4.Bottom 5 areas for literacy (broken down by ethnicity)
5.Top 5 areas for quality of life (broken down by ethnicity)
6.Bottom 5 areas for quality of life (broken down by ethnicity)
7.What is the correlation between literacy and quality of life? (broken down by ethnicity)

-----------------------------------------------------

Talking points:
1. Define literacy (health literacy)
2. Define quality of life
3. State which APIs were used
4. State what was pulled from APIs
5. Break down data (with charts)
6. Explain results
