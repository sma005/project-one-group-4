Questions
1. Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity
    Sharp spike in obesity in the US from 18-24 to 25-34. After that it climbs, until the 45-54 age group. Overweight has the same sharp rise, but it steadily climbs.

2. Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who are overweight
    Sharp spike in obesity in the US from 18-24 to 25-34. After that it climbs, until the 45-54 age group. Overweight groups continued to climb.

3. Percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity vs income
    As income brackets go up, Obesity tends to go down.

4. Obesity population who consume less than 1 fruits and/or 1 vegetables per day
    Non hispanic blacks and Hispanics have the most plots that are farther away from the linear regression line, meaning that the tendency to not eat one fruit or one vegetable is higher among people that are obese from those states.

    Based on the scatter points that are clumped together, the people who are obese from the states represented do not eat vegetables at the same rate, but the tendency not to eat fruit is much different when compared to other states.

    There is no correlation on obese people that do not eat fruit and obese people that do not eat vegetables.

5. Obesity trend from 2011 to 2021
    Over time, national obesity levels have gone up from 2011 until 2021

6. Obesity trend for gender from 2011 to 2021
    Females have had a sharper rise in obesity than males

7. Obesity trends for each state ranked
    The 3 US states that have the lowest obesity are Massachusetts, Colorado, and Hawaii. The three US states that have the highest obesity are Mississippi, Alabama, and West Virginia
